    ### title level 3 

    in fact you can use markdown wherever you want
    although titles are probably too much

    > a quotation (although our css still sucks on blockquotes)

    * some
    * bullets

    and both flavours of code insertion

    ```python
    # this code fenced with triple backticks
    # here tagged as python
    # check for coloring (not supported at first)
    def foo(n):
        return f"{n}**2 = {n**2}"
    ```

    *** 
    here we try the same but with a 4-space indentation which is
    less intuitive but well

        # this code is 4-space indented
        def bar(n):
            return f"{n}**3 = {n**3}"

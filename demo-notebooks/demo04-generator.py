# ## usual generator

# %% [markdown]
# `nbautoeval` has some provisions for dealing with generator functions; assume you ask students to write a generator that iterates over the n first integer squares, like e.g. :
#
# ```python
# def squares(n):
#     for i in range(n):
#         yield n**2
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# for dealing with this situation, you would create an instance of `ExerciseGenerator`; such an instance is created from
#
# * the solution (e.g. here the `squares` generator)
# * a list of inputs, each expressed as a `GeneratorArgs` instance
#
# the latter is similar to a regular `Args` instance, in that it describes the parameters to pass to the function; and in addition, `GeneratorArgs` allows to describe primarily how many times the generator needs to be triggered, and which of these results need to be taken into account; this is done through an *islice* attribute, a tuple whose (max. 3) pieces behave like the parameters to `range()` - or `islice()`
#
# let us see this on a first example

# %%
# as you can see, we display a list of the yielded values
# which is maybe not optimal

from exercises.squares import exo_squares
exo_squares.example()


# %% [markdown]
# Not that these examples are very realistic, but they intend to illustrate that mechanism :
#
# 1. first example has no *islice* set, so the generator obtained via `squares(2)` is triggered until its end, which amounts to 2 values
# 1. second example, `GeneratorArgs` is created with `islice=(1, 4)`; thus the generator is triggered 4 times, and only the last three results are displayed (and compared)
# 1. third example : `islice=(5,)`, meaning 5 runs; here the generator expires before that, it's fine, we just keep the 3 values
# 1. fourth example, the range (2, 8, 3) contains indices 2 and 5, so we only consider these runs; it is enough for the student code to coincide only on these 2 runs

# ## same with a limit
#
# when the requested generator does not end, it is tedious to have to create an *islice* for each and every dataset (test row), so it can be convenient to define the exercise instance with a global limit on the number of iterations. 
#
# here the exercise instance is here created with `max_iterations = 5`; it means that the framework will always stop after 5 iterations; the examples below try to illustrate the interaction of that setting with various *islice* settings.

# ## checking for types w/ an infinite iterator

# ### passing iterators as arguments to iterators

# %% [markdown]
# **BEWARE** that this feature is experimental; in 0.6.2 we had to explicitly tag the exercise with `copy_mode="tee"` for it to work properly; setting this flag on other gen-based exos, including `primes` above, tends to break things.

# %% [markdown]
# Objective here is to write an iterator that takes an iterator as argument, and iterates its derivative, i.e. the difference between consecutive terms.

# %% [markdown]
# This is currently very patchy and could use a second pass; the logic is kind of OK, including for cloning iterators
#
# However rendering an argument iterator in the 'Appel' column remains to be done, right now it is still totally unedible ;)

# it's far from clear from this table, but we run differential on 
# (*) itertools.count() so the expected output is a constant 1
# (*) squares() that iterates 0, 1, 4, 9, 16 ... 
#     so the expected outcome of differential is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..

# ### assignment

# %% [markdown]
# students are requested to write a `Gauge` class that has a single `x` attribute that must be guaranteed to be **between 0 and 100**; any attempt to set it otherwise should result in the attribute being set to 0 or 100, whichever is closest to the intended value.

# %% [markdown]
# ### workflow

# %% [markdown]
# this is quite similar but we need to write **statements** instead of just expressions
#
# * statements can be specified by creating a `ClassStep` object with the `statement=True` parameter
# * statements are run with `exec()` instead of `eval()`, and so it does not make sense to compare the behaviour of the student's class with the reference class; a following expression should be used to check for compliance

class Gauge:
    
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.x}"

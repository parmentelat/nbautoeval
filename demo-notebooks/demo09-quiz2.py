# ## shuffling and randomizing

# %% [markdown]
# about shuffling and randomizing of contentsÂ :
#
# * shuffling options within a question is a fairly straightforward feature and is the default in our model;
# * shuffling questions within a quiz is rather standard as well; it is not the default at this point, 
#   but can easily be turned on when creating a `Quiz` instance with `shuffle=True`
# * randomizing questions within a quiz is available as well as an experimental feature; for now you would need to define the number of questions to ask with random_questions=<n>
#
# one thing that is maybe **not optimal yet** is that in our model a quiz is a flat list of questions, there is no additional structure there, so e.g. if you want to say 'pick 4 questions among these 6, and then 3 among these 5' it is going to require 2 separate `Quiz` instances just to materialize this grouping

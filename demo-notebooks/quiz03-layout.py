# ## shuffling and randomizing

# %% [markdown]
# About **shuffling** of contentsÂ :
#
# * shuffling options within a question is a fairly straightforward feature and is the default in our model;
# * shuffling questions within a quiz is rather standard as well, and is the default as well
# * in both cases, this can be turned off by setting `shuffle=False` on the related `QuizQuestion` or `Quiz` object, respectively;
#
# Randimizing contents, OTOH, is **currently not supported**; all students will get the same set of questions and options, just in a different order. The effort required to get this right, in particular wrt storing results between 2 attempts, was deemed excessive at his point.
# One other thing that looked overly complex is that, in our model, a quiz is a flat list of questions, and there is no additional structure there, so e.g. if you want to say 'pick 4 questions among these 6, and then 3 among these 5' it would require 2 separate `Quiz` instances just to materialize this grouping.

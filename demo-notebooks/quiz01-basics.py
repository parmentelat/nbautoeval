# ## quizzes in YAML files

# %% [markdown]
# A quiz object is a collections of questions; each question has several options, at least one of which being correct.
#
# You can define a quiz inside a YAML file; we'll see a few simple examples below (it is possible to define quizzes in Python as well, but not recommended for getting started.
#
# One YAML file can define several quizzes.

# %% [markdown]
# ## quiz basicsÂ : contents, logic and scores
#
# in this notebook the correct answers are always the one starting with 'a' or $\alpha$

# %% {"hide_input": false, "scrolled": false}
from nbautoeval import run_yaml_quiz

# first argument:
#    the stem for the (yaml) filename, 
# second argument:
#    the name of the quiz defined in the YAML content
run_yaml_quiz("quiz01-basics", "quiz-basics")

# %%
# XXX this is for testing purposes only XXX
# it allows to 'reset' the history about this particular exercise
# if you reach the maximum number of attemps and want to start again
from nbautoeval.storage import storage_clear

# to that quiz

# ## Quiz epilogue, and explanations

# %% [markdown]
# When the student has it all right, or when `max_attempts` is reached (that is a Quiz attribute), the student can see their result; options that were not properly ticked or unticked are outlined in red; additional hints - code keyword is `explanation` are also unveiled if present.

# A quiz object is a collections of questions; each question has several options, at least one of which being correct.
#
# You can define a quiz inside a YAML file; we'll see a few simple examples below (it is possible to define quizzes in Python as well, but not recommended for getting started.
#
# One YAML file can define several quizzes.

#
# in this notebook the correct answers are always the one starting with 'a' or $\alpha$

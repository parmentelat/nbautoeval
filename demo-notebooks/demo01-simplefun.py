# # Note on the environment

# %% [markdown]
# ## Standalone

# %% [markdown]
# See `runserver.sh` so that this example notebook has its `PYTHONPATH` set up properly in a standalone jupyter run.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Under binder

# %%
# just so that it runs smoothly under binder
import sys
sys.path.append("..")

# # A sample exercise with functions

# %% [markdown]
# Let us start with a simple exercise that involves a basic one-argument function.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Explain the problem

# %%
# you need to evaluate this cell
# for the notebook to work properly
from exercises.percentages import exo_percentages

# %% [markdown]
# You are of course expected to describe in plain text what the exercise is all about. In our case we want the student to write a function that expects a string containing only uppercase letters among `ACGT`, and return a dictionary containing their respective percentages.

# %%
# an example of the expected outcome of your (correct) function
exo_percentages.example()


# %% [markdown]
# ## Tell the student to write their own code

# %% [markdown]
# As a rule of thumb, it is advisable to provide something that is syntaxically correct. This way it won't break complete evaluation of the notebook, which can come in handy when doublecheking.

# %%
# write your own implementation here
def percentages(adn):
#    from collections import Counter
#    c = Counter(adn)
#    l = len(adn)
#    ks = ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T')
#    return dict( [(k, 100*c[k]/l) for k in ks] )
    return "your code"


# %% [markdown]
# ## Auto correction

# %% [markdown]
# At this point you just need to insert a cell like the following, and students just need to evaluate
#  * their code
#  * the correction cell
# as many times as they want until it is all green.

# %%
# validez votre code en Ã©valuant cette cellule
exo_percentages.correction(percentages)

# %% [markdown]
# # Under the hood

# %% [markdown]
# Below is what the python code in `percentages.py` looks like; once comments are trimmed down, this amounts to about a dozen lines&nbsp;:

# %%
# %cat ../exercises/percentages.py
